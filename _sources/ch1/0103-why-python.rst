Why Learn Python?
=================

Python is a language for beginners
----------------------------------

Python is an accessible programming language that is easy for beginners to pick up.  Creating the classic program of printing "Hello world!" to the console is as simple as the following code:

.. activecode:: helloworld
	:caption: Hello world! in Python

	print "Hello world!"

Python code is a great language to start with because...
	- Code is relatively easy to read
	- Syntax is straightforward
	- Promotes good programmer habits (tabbing!)
	- There are many online tutorials to help you (like this one!)
	- There are numerous libraries, or code that other people wrote, that you can easily import and use to take shortcuts

However, don't get the idea that Python should only learned by beginners, because...

Python is a language for professionals
--------------------------------------

Even though it is accessible by beginners, it is also widely used in the professional world as well!  Below are a few examples...
	- Python has a very large presence in back-end web development.  A few examples of popular sites that use python are
		-Google
		-YouTube
		-DropBox
		-Reddit
		-The Onion
		-EventBrite.
	- It is also used a lot in the scientific community, dealing with simulations, data visualizations, testing, and more.
	- As a general purpose language, Python is also picked up for varying purposes: robotics, game design, web scraping, you name it!
