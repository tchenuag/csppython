Introduction to Variables
=========================

**Learning Target: I can use variables to store Python data.**

Now that we know how to express data, we can save them away using **variables**.

Think of variables as a storage box with labels.  Variables have the following characteristics:
	- They can only hold one value at a time (although the value could be a list of values, which we will learn later)
	- They have a name which you can use to reference its held value (like the label on the box)
	- The name given to a variable cannot be changed
	- They can hold values of any type (not true for all programming languages)

There's two actions that we're going to learn:
	- Saving something into a variable
	- Getting something from a variable

Variable Creation / Saving into Variables
-----------------------------------------

Let's start with how to name variables.  There are a few rules we have to follow when naming variables:
	- Variable names can only consist of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and underscores ( the character _ ).
	- Variable names cannot start with digits
