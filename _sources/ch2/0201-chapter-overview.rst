Chapter 2 Overview
==================

So far, all the programs we've been writing have been very linear - we write some code, then the code executes in order, top-down.

In this chapter, we will explore the following concepts:
	* Getting user input
	* If/Else/Else If statements
	* String indexing and String slicing
	* For loops
	* While loops

You will be creating the following projects:
	* A simple single-digit calculator
	* A word pluralizer
	* The classic "FizzBuzz" program
	* A Number Guessing Game

Good luck!
